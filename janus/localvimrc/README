Sometimes, when you work on different projects, you have the problem, that they use different indentation, tab expansion and so on. You need vimrc for each project that overrides your prefered settings from ~/.vimrc

This plugin searches for local vimrc files in the filesystem tree of the currently opened file. By default it searches for all ".lvimrc" files from the file's directory up to the root directory and loads them in reverse order. The filename and amount of loaded files is customizable through global variables.

Variables:

g:localvimrc_name
  Filename of local vimrc files. Defaults to ".lvimrc".

g:localvimrc_count
  On the way from root, the last localvimrc_count files are sourced. Defaults to -1 (all)

g:localvimrc_sandbox
  Source the found local vimrc files in a sandbox for security reasons. Defaults to 1.

g:localvimrc_ask
  Ask before sourcing any local vimrc file. Defaults to 1.
